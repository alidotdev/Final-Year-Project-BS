Points
1. HAR per train, epilepsy per error
2. Get Data and move towards pose estimation
3. Merge Epilepsy dataset and HAR Dataset
4. Use pretrained model on HAR, transfer learning and apply new getted dataset


Questions
1. Why we are focusing on Activities (instaed pose estimation, facial expression)
2. How we are going to detect epilepsy (Abnormality)
3. What does mean abnormality in Activity
4. if abnormality means new activity, 1 point fail badly
5. we have alot of seizre types, how we are going to cover all of them (some of them are not detected by activities, like MTLE, ETLE) => (Main Focus on Face Expressions)
