Computer Vision

Motivation of Computer Vision
1. Rapid Change in the industry  (2-3 examples)
2. Other industry taking motivation from CV (CNN used for speech recognition)

Simple CV Examples
1. Cat or not in image
2. Object Detection 
3. Neural Style Transfer


Challenges of Neural Network
Hardware Requirements for large data computation
More Data Require for good Training 


Dimentions


Lets Start with Computer Vision Problem

1. Face Detection + Overview of Neural netwrok (Step wise how neural network layer wise detect a face)
2. Edge Detection (Horizontal + Vertical)
3. Then what does mean learning with the help of this filter 
4. Padding Explaintion (Valid + Same)
5. Stride  + Formulas to calculate Output size
6. Start Playing with filters
6.1 Single filter output (6x6x3 * 3x3x3 = 4x4)
6.2 Multiple filter output (6x6x3 * 3x3x3x2 = 4x4x2)
6.3 Number of parametrs
6.4 Notations
6.5 Examples of ConvNet
7. Types of layers (Pool + FCL)
8. ResNet-5 Examples
9. Chart
10. Why Conv (Parameter Sharing + Sparsity of Connections)
